Researched plateaus, the typical surrounding land and how these things are formed so I have an idea of what my project needs to look like. 

My first idea for it was to create a lump, then flatten it at the top, but when I tried that, it didnt look natural at all, so I didnt do it that way.



Another idea I had was to have a cutoff of a ridge. So I used the gradient function to make a swift, linear decrease, and it did look better, especially when I added some noise, but no matter what angle I put the gradient at, it didnt look quite right. 

I began by creating

Assignment is due quite soon
I have told myself that since it is somthing that I can do at home, I wouldn't need to do it in class and have subsequently not done it at home or in class.

I should not do this. This is what causes cool assignments to be so late and shoddy.

This frustrates me because I know this assignment would be very fun and would build usefull skills, but is also time consuming, such that by the time I have started, I am already distracted with somthing else

This blog is about the last week of Term 3 and the first week of Term 4. I did not do any work in the holidays because I didn't exist.

**Week 9 term 3**

told in vauge terms what the assignment could be, and how to prepare in the holidays

**Week 1 term 4**

Assignment is given

I need to create a landmass in World Machine and then populate it with stuff in unity

I am going to make a plateau. Hurrah

I do not know how that works so further research is necessary.

This week I should have nearly finished the Procedural Terrain Generation with World Machine document by using shapes and Layout generators and random generators and also importing heightmap to create realistic terrain.

The generators create a modulated plane that follows some rules, defined by the generators, called a heightmap. The basic terrain veiw uses this Heightmap and adds colour based on altitude.

The trouble is, I have three assignments that I am behind on, and all of my free time has been spent doing that, so i have not done this document apart from playing around with World Machine.

Next time I have the opportunity to organise my work, I will do so more efficiently, and will not be late and disorganised again

**World Machine**

Dual-booted my Mac using Bootcamp so that I could run world machine. Understanding the basic functions like the perlin noise generators and combiner functions. Computer restarted and didn't have any saved images, so had to restart, which is why this entry is so late

The perlin noise generators generate a heightmap for the output

The average combine function combines several heigtmaps or bitmaps by taking the average of the height or colour

**The Immersion powerpoint from the portal**

Looked at immersion powerpoint on portal but did not finish reflection

Flow is the ideal state of a person when playing a game. it has... this creates a deeper connection between the player and the game because it keeps the player "in the game". Immersion is like Flow in that the player keeps themself in the game, but rather than the "Perfect" experiance, it is the closest achievable experiance the player can have with the played.

**World Machine**

Starting procedural generation in class next week and need to use World Machine. World Machine cannot run on Mac. I need to find somthing that does the same thing, that i can run, or use a device that can run World Mchine.

Some solutions i have for this are:

Dual-booting my computer with Bootcamp

Running world Machine thorugh WineHQ

Finding a computer with a different OS to bring into class instead
